    <h1>Aryabhata</h1>
    <p>Aryabhata (ISO: Āryabhaṭa) or Aryabhata I(476–550 CE) was an Indian mathematician and astronomer of the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy. He flourished in the Gupta period and produced works such as the Aryabhatiya (which mentions
        that in 3600 Kali Yuga, 499 CE, he was 23 years old) and the Arya-siddhanta.</p>
    <p>Aryabhata created a system of phonemic number notation in which numbers were represented by consonant-vowel monosyllables. Later commentators such as Brahmagupta divide his work into Ganita ("Mathematics"), Kalakriya ("Calculations on Time") and Golapada
        ("Spherical Astronomy").</p>
    <p>His pure mathematics discusses topics such as determination of square and cube roots, geometrical figures with their properties and mensuration, arithmetric progression problems on the shadow of the gnomon, quadratic equations, linear and indeterminate
        equations.
